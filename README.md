 The focus of this assignment is to explore the Seven Deadly Sins (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins) through social media analytics. We extracted physical fitness sentiments from Twitter using text analysis and classified cities in Australia having positive sentiments.

We compared this data with AURIN open source datasets and presented in a react based UI. The video is included in the git repository.
